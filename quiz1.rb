# 1. The value of a is 1.

# 2. An array is an organized list of values sorted by a numbered index.
# In a hash, the slots aren't in a row, and you can use any object to
# refer to a value, not simply a number.

# 3. [1, 2, 3, 3]
# [1, 2, 3]
# [1, 2, 3]

# 4. What's the difference between the map and select methods for the Array class?
# map creates a new array containing values returned by the block.
# select creates a new array containing all elements of the array for which the given block is true.

# 5. h = {'String1' => a, 'String2' => 2}

# 6. 'no way!'

# 7. x is 4.

# 8. Since x is undefined, it results in an error.
